# Christmas Tree

## Happy Holidays!

> This project will show you how to draw a christmas tree in Python.



### Requirement

```python
pip install turtle
```



### Small Tree

Never underestimate the power of scout's code.

```python
height = 5
starts = 1

for i in range(height):
    print((' ' * (height - i)) + ('*' * starts))
    starts += 2

print((' ' * height) + '|')
```

Then you will get...
